# Linear-Regression-Manual
This is an manual linear regression process to understand what the actual method can do in ML process.
Linear Regression is the powerful algorithm of the Machine Learning.
Linear Regression is the "Supervised Algorithm" of Machine Learning.
In this algorithm we predict some values on the basis of the dataset.
The rule to apply the Linear Regression is that, if we have some data in the numeric form and limited data is in categorical form.
Linear Regression Process:
.> First we convert the categorical data into numeric form and then apply the Linear Regression.
.> After converting we first identify the "independent variable" and "dependent variable".
.> After that calculate the mean of the other columns, and apply prediction on the basis of the independent & dependent variable.
  The Linear Regression manual calculation is given in the .py file.
